# randomdatatools

Simliar to another project of a similar name, a collection of random data transformation, storage, and analysis tools.
A lot of this will be classes/functions, and scripts converted to classes/functions, of code I've developed over the
years for one reason or another. Useful to me at one time or another, potentially useful in the future, possibly useful
to someone else.

As my other projects documentation is simple right now. I have plans to enhance it with Sphinx or reStructured Text.
